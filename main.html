                    <p>Hi my name is Daniel and I am originally from the Boston
                    area. I went to the University of Massachetts, Amherst and
                    after graduating, I moved to California to work at a ski
                    resort for a couple seasons. I had some amazing
                    snowboarding seasons with an incredible amount of snow.
                    Unfortunately they haven't had much snow accumulation since
                    I moved on. I then attended graduate school at the
                    University of Texas at Austin and recieved an M.S. in
                    Geosciences.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My goal is to combine my advanced science degree with
                    web development to help the general public understand
                    scientific data. I would love to do web development for a
                    company involved in science, but my future is wide
                    open.</p>

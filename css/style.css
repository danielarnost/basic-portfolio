	<h1> About Me </h1>
	
	
	<h3>
		<p>Hi my name is Daniel and I am from the Boston area.  I went to the University of Massachetts, Amherst and after graduating, I moved to California to work at a ski resort for a couple seasons.  I had a couple of amazing snowboarding seasons with an incredible amount of snow, unfortunately they haven't had much snow accumulation since I moved on. I then attended graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin and recieved an M.S. in Geosciences. </p>

		</p> My goal is to combine my advanced science degree with web development to help the general public understand scientific data. I would love to do web development for a company involved in science, but my future is wide open. </p>

		<p> I am like to ride bikes and rock climb.  After moving to Austin from Massachusetts, I am lucky enough to get to commute to work on my bicycle every day of the year.  I enjoy watching movies (documentaries, dramas, classics, etc.) and I and am starting to pick up a little basketball. </p>
